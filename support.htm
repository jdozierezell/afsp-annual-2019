<p>Our Interactive Screening Program provides individual members of school and workplace communities with a safe and anonymous way to connect with help when they need support and resources.</p>
<p>Individuals in need of help are not always ready to connect to mental health services. The Interactive Screening Programâ€™s web-based platform offers a screening for stress, depression, and other mental health concerns, followed by the opportunity to connect with a program counselor within the mental health services available to them, and have an anonymous electronic dialogue. Individuals can decide to connect with available mental health services.</p>
<p>The program is utilized by mental health services at institutions of higher education, including medical and professional degree schools, hospitals and health systems, law enforcement agencies, and other workplace settings through Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs).</p>

<p>One by one, throughout our communities, people are sharing and spreading their knowledge and experiences of how we can all&#8212;as members of our home, work, friend, family, school, and faith networks&#8212;support ourselves and one another.</p>

<div id="support_articles">

<div id="support_logo"><img src="images/support_logo.png" alt=""/></div>

<p>Thousands of suicide loss survivors gathered at events around the world on November 17th for International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day. The events are an opportunity for suicide loss survivors to find comfort and gain understanding, while being supported by others in their community as they share stories of hope and healing from a loss.</p>

<div id="conversations_logo"><img src="images/conversations_logo.png" alt=""/></div>

<p>Healing Conversations, formerly known as the Survivor Outreach Program, gives those who have lost loved ones to suicide the opportunity to talk with our experienced volunteers, who are themselves survivors of suicide loss.</p>
<p>Available in person, on the phone or by video chat following a suicide death, these Healing Conversations provide connection and understanding in the moments people need it most.</p>
<p>Nearly 800 people from every corner of the country requested a connection through our Healing Conversations Program this past yearâ€‰â€”â€‰an increase of 22% over the previous year. We currently have over 500 trained Healing Conversations volunteers.</p>


<h3>Supporting Those Who Support Others</h3>
<p>
Grief following a death by suicide requires a specific type of support. Over 450 mental health professionals participated in our Suicide Bereavement Clinician Training Program this year, and over 240 people attended the Support Group Facilitator Training program. These programs educate those in helping roles about how to better support suicide loss survivors.</p>

<h1>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h1>
<h2>Tom Steen</h2>
<h3>Connecticut</h3>

<div class="volunteer_info">
<div class="volunteer_image"><img src="images/support_steen_spotlight.png" alt="Tom Steen" /></div>

<div class="volunteer_profile">

<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m still healing.&#8221;</strong></p>


<p>Tom Steen had been involved in nonprofit work for 30 years before losing his son Tyler to suicide in 2009. Soon after that, he returned from retirement to become Executive Director of the Capital Area Substance Abuse Council (CASAC), where he found his work dovetailing with mental health, and joined Connecticut&#8217;s Suicide Prevention Advisory Board. He then became involved with AFSP, recruiting and mobilizing a team of volunteers to found our Northern Connecticut Chapter.</p>

<p>This past year, in addition to overseeing the merger of two chapters, Tom provided suicide prevention training at schools and workplaces, including our More Than Sad program for young adults, and Talk Saves Lives modules addressing firearms safety, and the LGBTQ community. </p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still healing,&#8221; Tom says of his loss. &#8220;If I had just known a little more about suicide prevention when Tyler died, he might still be alive today. My journey of healing has allowed me to speak openly about my loss and offer a message of hope for those who struggle.&#8221;</p>

<h1>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h1>
<h2>Nikki Scott</h2>
<h3>Tennessee</h3>

<div class="volunteer_info">
<div class="volunteer_image"><img src="images/support_scott_spotlight.png" alt="Nikki Scott"/></div>

<div class="volunteer_profile">
<p><strong>&#8220;Sitting with someone in their loss, holding space, has been deeply healing for them and for myself.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Nikki Scott lost her mother Viola to suicide in December 1999. Moving to Tennessee nine years later, she attended the Music Row Out of the Darkness Community Walk in Nashville, where she met those from her local chapter. Before long, she started the chapter&#8217;s Healing Conversations program, then known as the Survivor Outreach Program. She now serves on the Tennessee Board of Directors and the national Loss &amp; Healing Council, as well as co-facilitating a support group for suicide loss survivors. Her efforts in supporting other survivors of suicide loss helped lead the chapter to receive an AFSP award for their International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Survivors of suicide loss are where my heart is. When I talk to survivors, it&#8217;s like I can hear an unspoken message between all the words: one that only fellow survivors can understand. Every minute I spend working with AFSP is healing for me. The work I do with AFSP, helping others, is part of my mom&#8217;s legacy. I do the work in her honor.&#8221; </p>

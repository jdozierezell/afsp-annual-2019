<p>This year, nearly 360,000 people across the U.S. raised awareness and funds for suicide prevention by participating in one of 600 Out of the Darkness Walks. Our walks are how many people learn about our organization for the first time, welcoming them into a supportive and loving community, and mobilizing them in the movement to #StopSuicide.</p>

<p>The vast majority of our organizationâ€™s funding comes from our Out of the Darkness Community, Campus, and Overnight Walks. More importantly, the friendships formed by the people who walk are deeply personal, and can last a lifetime.</p>

<p>The spring marked the 10th year of Campus Walks, with teens, young adults, faculty, and family members from 160 campuses spreading the message that mental health is just as important as physical health, and that suicide can be prevented. Students at Colorado&#8217;s Arapahoe High School rallied to support their first walk, which became the top Campus Walk in the country with more than $77,000 raised and 1,200 participants.</p>

<div class="accordion_content">
<p>The need for further suicide prevention education in schools for young people is very real. Suicide is currently the second leading cause of death among youth ages 10â€“24 years old.</p>
<p>D.A.R.E presents AFSPâ€™s <a href="https://afsp.org/our-work/education/more-than-sad/" target="_blank">More Than Sad: Teen Depression</a> prevention education program for teens is designed to engage teens in recognizing the signs of depression in themselves and others; address and remove the sense of shame some people associate with mental health; demystify the treatment process; and encourage students to talk to a trusted adult about mental health.</p>
<p>Implemented in schools throughout the United States, D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) teaches students good decision-making skills designed to help them lead safe and healthy lives and cope with high risk circumstances including drugs, alcohol, violence and bullying.</p>
<p>By collaborating with D.A.R.E to present More Than Sad, we can help further spread potentially lifesaving education and resources to young people, and reinforce the understanding that their mental health is as real as their physical health: a lesson that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Since launching in 2015, <strong>Talk Saves Lives has reached nearly 110,000 people</strong>. This program has been presented to a wide range of community audiences including police officers, senior center staff, construction workers, and others who wish to learn more about suicide prevention.</p>

These one-day events feature nationally recognized, innovative researchers and highlight local resources and programs working to prevent suicide at the community level.</p>
<p>This year, our <a href="https://afsp.org/our-work/education/stronger-communities-lgbtq-suicide-prevention/" target="_blank">Stronger Communities</a> conference series was brought to five states&#8212;North Dakota, South Carolina, New York, California and Indianaâ€‰â€”â€‰increasing awareness for LGBTQ suicide prevention with nearly 400 attendees.</p>

<p>Many people go to their religious leader when they are grieving the loss of a loved one by suicide, or are struggling themselves. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve partnered with Soul Shop<sup>&#8482;</sup> to provide one-day training workshops to equip clergy, staff, lay pastors, and faith-based clinicians with resources and guidance to foster hope and healing&#8212;part of an ongoing, strategic effort to shift the way faith communities address mental health and suicide prevention.</p>

<a href="JavaScript:Void(0);" class="accordion_toggle accordion_toggle-closed">Supporting Those Who Struggle</a>
<div class="accordion_content">
<p>Those who care for a loved one at risk for suicide often have many questions about how best to support the individual and their recovery. &#8220;Lived experience&#8221; is a term we use for people who have made a suicide attempt or struggle with suicidal thoughts. AFSP&#8217;s new program, piloted by seven chapters&#8212;â€‰San Diego, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, Long Island, Illinois, and Central Florida&#8212;is designed for those supporting someone at risk for suicide and helps participants understand what we know about suicide, providing them with strategies to help them support the individual&#8217;s well-being.</p>
<p>When someone is at risk for suicide, it can be a difficult time for both the individual as well as those who want to be there for them. By developing this important, evidence-informed program, our goal is to provide guidance, encouragement and hope for everyone involved.</p>

<a href="JavaScript:Void(0);" class="accordion_toggle accordion_toggle-closed">Updating the Model School Policy</a>
<div class="accordion_content">
<p>In collaboration with the American School Counselor Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and The Trevor Project, this year we updated the <a href="https://afsp.org/our-work/education/model-school-policy-suicide-prevention/" target="_blank">Model School Policy on Suicide Prevention</a>, a comprehensive guidebook for school administrators and policy makers containing best practices in suicide prevention, intervention and postvention policies for Kâ€“12 schools.</p>
<p>When the first Model School Policy was released in 2014, only five states required suicide prevention procedures for their school districts. Today, thanks to the work of our volunteer Field Advocates and other mental health organizations, there are now 22 states with laws that require Kâ€“12 school districts to have a suicide prevention policy in place. The Model School Policy provides a template for school districts to use as a guide when developing their own policies. The document is free and available to the public through afsp.org/modelschoolpolicy. We also worked with education technology company GoGuardian to guide them in their own efforts, and to help bring the Model School Policy, and our More Than Sad teacher education program, to more schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that teachers and others who interact with students daily are in a prime position to recognize the signs of suicide risk, and to make appropriate referrals. This document was created to provide further guidance to schools on how to best address suicide attempts and to support students who may be experiencing suicidal ideation,&#8221; said Dr. Doreen Marshall, AFSP Vice President of Programs.</p>

We hosted a live panel discussion with Instagram, Teen Vogue and SELF magazine on how to have a # <a href="https://afsp.org/campaigns/real-convo-toolkit/" class="textLink" target="_blank">RealConvo</a> about mental health with your friends and loved ones. Our efforts made us a <strong>finalist for PRNews&#8217; Digital Awards Best Instagram Campaign</strong>.</p>

<p>We also collaborated with 20 illustrators to create #RealConvo artwork. Our Mental Health Month Toolkit web page provided a single location for visitors to find videos, sharable graphics, blogs and other ways to get involved in the AFSP community. During May, the toolkit received nearly <strong>9,000 visits</strong> and resulted in over <strong>25,000 interactions</strong> with the content on that page. It was our seventh most visited page for the month.</p>
<p>Our follower count went up <strong>7,000</strong> over the course of the month. By the end of May, we had nearly <strong>37,000 followers</strong> on Instagram</p>

<p>Our Seize the Awkward campaign continued into National Suicide Prevention Week in September, when we launched new videos by musicians AminÃ©, Hayley Kiyoko, Christina Perri and Lindsey Stirling. We used the month as an opportunity to spread information about suicide prevention, creating social media graphics, blogs and videos providing people the guidance they need to have a #RealConvo about mental health. We also took part in events including Twitter chats in partnership with the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; a webinar with Dr. Christine Moutier and members of our Scientific Council on implementing new health system standards for preventing suicide; and a briefing on Capitol Hill presented by AFSP and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</p>

<h1>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h1>
<h2>Amy Reed</h2>
<h3>Nebraska</h3>

<div class="volunteer_info">
<div class="volunteer_image"><img src="images/aware_reed_spotlight.png" alt=""/></div>

<div class="volunteer_profile">

<p><strong>&#8220;I knew from my first Walk that the people I met were my family.&#8221;</strong></p>


<p>Amy Reed had never heard of AFSP until she lost her best friend Terri in 2011. In Fall 2011, she volunteered in the Omaha Out of the Darkness Community Walk. The interactions Amy had with people had a profound effect on her. Amy then joined the chapter&#8217;s board and helped grow the Omaha Walk from just over 1,500 participants to nearly 5,000 in 2019.</p>

<p>Organizing walks are not without challenges. Due to a renovation, a new location had to be found for upcoming events, with Amy leading the way in organizing logistics, toiling over maps, parking, and other details. But that wasn&#8217;t all. Three weeks prior to a recent walk, just as Amy&#8217;s daughter, who lives with quadriplegia, had to be hospitalized, the company supplying tents, tables, chairs, the stage, and truck rental went out of business. With the help of family and other volunteers, Amy not only conquered these obstacles, but boosted the scale of business donations by creating a fundraising partnership committee, helping the walk to raise almost $200,000, which will go toward our many programs and efforts. </p>

<p>&#8220;I knew from my first Community Walk that the people I met were my family, my tribe, my source of inspiration. The walks give people a space to feel safeâ€‰â€”â€‰to openly grieve, while fighting for the cause. Organizing the walk is an absolute honor. It&#8217;s not only healing for the now thousands of people who attend, but it&#8217;s also healing for me. There&#8217;s a strength in being open and vulnerable in our grief. Loss isn&#8217;t something we get over, but we can grow within it and around it, allow it to be a part of our lives, and inspire and teach other people with our experiences.&#8221; </p>

<h1>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h1>
<h2>Natalia Chimbo-Andrade</h2>

<div class="volunteer_profile">
<p><strong>&#8220;I am a firm believer that education is power.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>As a suicide attempt survivor who has also lost friends and family, Natalia Chimbo-Andrade&#8217;s personal story is what motivates her as a board member of our Arizona chapter. This year, Natalia was instrumental in spreading education to diverse audiences in her community, through programs like Talk Saves Lives, It&#8217;s Real: College Students and Mental Health, and More Than Sad, including Spanish language presentations, in school, hospital and workplace settings, as well as to state political representatives, to better inform them so they are equipped to help their constituents.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to inform the public about warning signs and risk factors, as well as the impact suicide leaves on a community. I hope to inspire and motivate others to create a suicide-safer community. Hearing how our efforts impact others gives me hope that we are getting closer to putting an end to suicide!&#8221; </p>

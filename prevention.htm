<p>Our state-of-the-art research portfolio helps to address suicide, which is currently the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. By working with other national research organizations and sharing the findings of our researchers through conferences and Research Connection Programs, we spread knowledge, and help to shape the agenda for future suicide prevention research.</p>
<p>AFSP was founded as a research organization dedicated to exploring how to save lives. Over 30 years later, AFSP remains the largest private funder of suicide prevention research, shaping suicide prevention strategies around the world in collaboration with our Scientific Council, Scientific Advisors, and research grantees.</p>
<p>This year, AFSP funded <strong>26 new research grants</strong>, totaling over <strong>$6.27 million</strong>. Of the new grants funded this year, three <strong>Focus Grants</strong> explore a range of exciting areas of research, totaling almost <strong>$4 million</strong>.</p>

<h3>Focus Grants</h3>
<p>Focus Grants are targeted, novel and potentially high-impact studies focusing on designated areas of study. This year, AFSP has funded two new Blue Sky Focus Grants, and one Short-Term Risk Focus Grant.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Sky Focus Grants</strong> are those which are open to all fields, supporting innovative and potentially impactful novel areas of suicide prevention research that are beyond the scope of our Innovation Grants.</p>
<p><strong>Short-Term Risk Focus Grants</strong> are concentrated on assessment and/or interventions to identify and reduce short-term risk for suicide in clinical settings.</p>

<h3>Opiate Suicide Study in Patients with Major Depression</h3>
<p>Alan Schatzberg, M.D. of Stanford University was awarded a Blue Sky Focus Grant totaling over $1.4 million for a study on ketamine, a pain relief medicine that has been shown to rapidly reduce severe suicidal ideation. The study examines how we might sustain this anti-suicidal effect over time.</p>

<h3>An Integrated Approach to Understanding the Biology of Suicidal Behavior</h3>
<p>Virginia Willour, Ph.D. of the University of Iowa was awarded a Blue Sky Focus Grant totaling almost $1.5 million towards her research examining how genetics, and brain structure and function, are related to suicide through the study of individuals with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior.</p> 

</div>

<div class="spotlight_right">
<h3>Inpatient Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy to Reduce Suicide Risk Post-Discharge</h3>	
<p>David Tolin, Ph.D. of the Institute of Living/Hartford Hospital was awarded a Short-Term Risk Focus Grant of over $1 million, studying the effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on patients managing suicidal ideation and behavior post-discharge from the hospital, when they are at particularly high-risk. </p>

<p>Our chapters hosted 45 State Capitol Day events in Spring 2019, bringing our advocates together to meet with public officials and discuss how to help reduce suicide in their states and communities. This year, they urged legislators to support bills that would impact suicide prevention in K–12 schools, training for health professionals, mental health parity enforcement, prohibitions on conversion therapy, and suicide prevention planning and infrastructure at the state level, among other state priority issues. </p>

With this in mind, this year we partnered with Mental Health for US — a nonpartisan, educational initiative focused on improving candidate’s and policymaker’s understanding and knowledge of mental health and making the topic a vibrant part of national policy conversations. </p>
<p>The partnership, co-chaired by former Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR) and former U.S. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy (D-RI), was launched at our Annual Advocacy Forum. Other coalition leaders in addition to AFSP include The Kennedy Forum, The Jed Foundation, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Council for Behavioral Health, Mental Health America, One Mind, and Thomas Scattergood Behavioral Health Foundation.</p>

<p>Our research serves as the catalyst for the Project 2025 initiative, which has the bold goal of reducing the annual suicide rate in the U.S. 20% by 2025.</p>
<p>By partnering with organizations in communities across the U.S. to deliver evidence-informed programs, policies and interventions, we know we can and will save lives. This year we entered a new phase of the initiative, including the debut of a new <a href="http://afsp.org/project2025" target="_blank" class="content_link">interactive website</a> and the announcement of several exciting partnerships, each aligned with the four critical areas that have been identified to save the most lives in the shortest amount of time: firearms, healthcare systems, emergency departments and correctional institutions.</p>

<p>51% of all suicides in the U.S. are by firearm, which is why we’ve partnered with the National Shooting Sports Foundation to help distribute suicide prevention materials to its national network of retailers and ranges. Our chapters have presented our firearms-specific suicide prevention education program in their communities over 100 times since its development. We’re also partnering with Everytown for Gun Safety and The Well-Armed Woman to promote suicide prevention in relation to firearms.</p>

</p>


<p>Markita Madden-Puckett made a significant contribution to suicide prevention this year by creating an important dialogue with the black and international community (largely Hispanic-Latino) in the rural area of Virginia in which she lives. Markita sought out opportunities to engage with diverse audiences by partnering with the NAACP, and through events such as the African American Festival, Pride Festivals, and International Festival in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p>Markita, who lost her father and two brothers to suicide, sees her mission as breaking down barriers, and starting and keeping conversations going in communities that do not readily discuss suicide and mental health. </p>

<p>&#8220;As a volunteer for AFSP, I feel the impact of unspoken beliefs rooted deeply within my community, in which many feel they cannot openly admit that mental health struggles are real. Our message of prevention has to be both culturally aware and culturally sensitive. I&#8217;ve found that having one-on-one interactions in which I share my personal story can lead to wonderful moments of connection.&#8221;</p>

<strong>&#8220;AFSP Advocacy can transform hope into reality.&#8221;</strong>
</p>

<p>Steve Moore lost his son, Paul, to suicide in 2006. He has since devoted himself to the cause of suicide prevention, particularly in the form of advocacy, as the co-chair and public policy chair of our Illinois chapter, as well as serving on AFSP&#8217;s National Public Policy Council.  </p>

<p>This year, Steve drafted a bill that made suicide prevention the responsibility of the Illinois Department of Public Health, and added the Zero Suicide model for health care to the state&#8217;s suicide prevention plan. In addition to testifying before Senate and House committees and leading a letter-writing campaign to legislators, Steve organized the chapter&#8217;s State Capitol Day around the bill. Visitors to the State Capitol Building placed rose petals in memory of those who died by suicide on a large board with the word HOPE that was set up on 
the first floor. &#8220;The HOPE board was a positive way to raise awareness and encourage public participation in our cause,&#8221; said Steve. </p> 

<p>The bill passed both houses unanimously and was signed by the Governor. Steve concluded, &#8220;Because suicide prevention will now be a line item in the state budget, our future advocacy can focus on increasing state funding for suicide prevention.&#8221; </p>

<strong>&#8220;Why wait to make a difference?&#8221;</strong>
</p>

<p>As the Programs Coordinator at Santiam Correctional Institution, Dan Bielenberg knew that both his co-workers as well as the incarcerated people are particularly vulnerable to suicide, and that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and prisons. He had also attended a Community Walk held in Salem, Oregon in 2016, and was moved by the experience of seeing so many people walking to bring suicide out of the darkness. </p> 

<p>Describing the event to George Skurtu, a trusted adult in custody serving as a prison clerk, he inspired George to respond, &#8220;I want to do that when I get out.&#8221; Dan&#8217;s response to George was, &#8220;Why not do it now?&#8221; </p> 

<p>Under Dan&#8217;s guidance, the first ever Out of the Darkness Walk to take place inside a state prison was held at Santiam Correctional Institution. Thanks to Dan&#8217;s initiative, six prison walks were held this year in Oregon, each one accompanied by a presentation of the Talk Saves Lives program. Building on this momentum, Dan now speaks at correctional facilities in other states, inspiring others to do the same.</p>

<p><strong class="grants_title">Using Genomic and Clinical Data to Distinguish Child Psychiatry Outpatients at High Risk for Suicide</strong>
$29,989<br />
Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant<br />
Research Area: P, G</p>
<p>We need to learn more about youth suicide. Closely examining 1,400 youths receiving treatment at a psychiatric clinic with regard to diagnosis, depression, aggression, genetic samples, and other factors provides a unique opportunity. Given that youth with attention deficit disorder and major depression have higher rates of suicide, taking a multifactored approach will increase our capacity to develop targeted interventions to prevent this second leading cause of death in youth.</p>

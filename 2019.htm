<p>We began as a grassroots effort, when a small group of families who&#8217;d lost loved ones to suicide banded together with scientists in an effort to learn more. As we have grown and expanded to become the nation&#8217;s largest suicide prevention organization, with chapters in every state, what we do is still rooted in communities, and the individuals who comprise them. </p>

<h2>Honoring Our Chapters</h2>
</div>

<div class="section_right">
<div class="right_intro">
<p>In January, volunteers and staff from across the country gathered in Dallas for the 14th Annual Chapter Leadership Conference. Focusing on the theme &#8220;Community Connections to Save Lives,&#8221; the event was an inspiring look ahead, as well as an opportunity to applaud the amazing work of our chapters nationwide.</p>
<p>The AFSP South Carolina Chapter (above) was awarded Overall Chapter of the Year at the annual Chapter Awards Banquet. The chapter held seven Out of the Darkness Community Walks, and six Campus Walks, overseeing a significant increase in both participation and fundraising efforts for both events. They helped to present 60 education and prevention programs, including more than 20 Talk Saves Lives, More Than Sad, and It’s Real presentations across the state. They have also been a driving force in the relaunch of the State Suicide Prevention Coalition and became the first AFSP chapter to form a partnership with a state agency, the South Carolina Department of Mental Health, through the South Carolina Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative.</p>

<h1>Innovation Grants</h1>
<p>Our 2019 Innovation Grants each takes a unique approach, across the following six categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>N – Neurobiological</strong>  How do brain structure and neurochemical function contribute to suicide?</li>
<li><strong>P – Psychological</strong>  What are the risk factors and warning signs for suicide?</li>
<li><strong>G – Genetic</strong>  What genetic pathways are associated with suicide risk, and can we develop biological interventions and treatments?</li>
<li><strong>T – Treatment</strong>  What treatments — like therapies and medications — are effective at reducing suicide?</li>
<li><strong>C – Community</strong>  What universal prevention programs — like hotlines, gatekeeper training, and community-based programs — are the most effective?</li>
<li><strong>L – Loss Survivors</strong>  What is the impact of suicide loss, and what helps the healing process?</li>
</ul>

Grant Type: Linked Standard Research Grant<br />
Research Area: T</p>
<p>Training involves more than just knowledge; it also involves increasing self-awareness and empathy. Improved and increased training is needed for mental health clinicians who work with individuals at risk for suicide. Creating and testing the feasibility of the first multimodal virtual human interaction training program for clinicians working with suicidal patients provides a highly efficient way of improving clinicians’ therapeutic skills, and potentially reducing patients’ overall risk of suicide.</p>

Grant Type: Distinguished Investigator Grant<br />
Research Area: G</p>
<p>Early life stress has been shown to contribute to suicide risk, but the mechanisms are unknown. Genetics play a role in brain function, and alterations in expression of specific microRNAs — the parts of genes that are responsive to environmental cues — may have an effect. Understanding the relationship between microRNAs, stress, and suicide has implications for developing novel treatments and suicide prevention strategies.</p>

Research Area: N</p>
<p>The gut and the brain are connected, and gastrointestinal inflammation has been found to be related to depression and risk for suicidal behavior. Contributors such as life stress, aggression, and impulsiveness also play a role in suicide risk. Comparing people hospitalized for a suicide attempt with those psychiatrically hospitalized for other reasons, and following them over time, will allow for the study of how these factors change and associate over time. The availability of dietary interventions offers the possibility of innovative and effective treatment.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is one of many potential contributors to suicidal ideation and behavior. It is not clear if risk is related to the pain itself, how the pain is perceived, or factors such as lack of social support and feeling like a burden. Measuring how people feel, think, and experience their pain and their social support over time may provide information about the relationship between chronic pain and suicide.</p>

<p>When people are at risk for suicidal behavior, they often have difficulty thinking flexibly, and experience their options as limited. The neurotransmitter, or brain chemical, GABA, may play a role. This cognitive inflexibility can be modeled in animals, providing an opportunity to test various medication treatments. Learning about the impact of specific medications on cognitive inflexibility may reveal options for treating a person thinking of suicide.</p>

<p>The rate of suicides in households that have a firearm is higher than non-gun owning households. This is not a matter of differences in mental health or other known factors. To better understand this, comparing one million gun owners with nineteen million who do not own guns and analyses with linked data from voting and death records may shed some light. Lessons for community interventions and prevention strategies will be identified.</p>

Grant Type: Standard Research Grant<br />
Research Area: T</p>
<p>There is a 13 times higher rate of death by suicide in people with opioid use disorder (OUD) as compared to the general population. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence is a standard part of treatment. By examining medical records and pharmacy data linked with death records of a large group of patients treated with MAT in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), this study will examine whether MAT is associated with reduced suicide deaths among opioid users.</p>

<p>Most people visit their primary care physician at least once a year. This provides an opportunity to screen for suicide risk.

Research Area: P</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing number of opioid-overdose deaths have largely been treated as accidents. However, a significant proportion of these deaths are likely suicides. By conducting psychological autopsies with family and friends of those who have died by suicide, it may be possible to measure the magnitude of misclassification and characterize factors associated with suicide and accidental deaths. This has important consequences for targeting prevention efforts.</p>

Research Area: N, P</p>
<p>Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents often precedes a shift to suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Understanding this process is critical for interfering with that transition. Theory suggests that NSSI and the transition to suicidal behavior is related to one’s experience of physical pain and social rejection. Brain imaging during tasks that evoke these experiences and follow-up assessments can reveal how brain function underlies NSSI and subsequent suicidal behavior.</p>

<p>By studying the brains of people who died by suicide and comparing them with those who died from other causes, we can examine changes in genes and differences in the brain cells, called neurons, and the spaces between neurons, the synapses, where information is exchanged. Neurons can be generated from skin cells and compared to brain neurons. Learning about the difference between skin and brain neurons presents an opportunity for learning about the biology of suicide.</p>

<h2>Message from the Treasurer</h2>

<p>This past year has been one of remarkable growth, which has made it possible to increase the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s investment across all areas of its work. AFSP also continues to manage its funds wisely, which has earned AFSP Charity Navigator’s highest rating of 4-stars.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from AFSP’s most recent audit:</p>

<p>Total net revenue grew by more than $4.6 million in fiscal year 2019, from $37.06 million to $41.7 million, a 12.5% increase. </p>

<p>Expenses for research, advocacy, prevention and education, and support to people affected by suicide increased from $21.5 million in fiscal year 2018 to $25 million in fiscal year 2019, which represents a 16.3% increase in the investment in AFSP’s mission.</p>

<p>In spite of its rapid growth, AFSP’s fundraising and administration cost stayed approximately constant at 17.7% of total expense, allowing 82.3% of our expense to support research and programs.</p>
